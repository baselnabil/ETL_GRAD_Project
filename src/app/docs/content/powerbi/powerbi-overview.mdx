title: PowerBI Integration Overview
description: Utilizing PowerBI for data visualization and insights.
---


In this project, we leverage PowerBI to create interactive and insightful visualizations that help us understand various aspects of the data. By integrating PowerBI, we can effectively communicate the results of our data analysis and machine learning models to stakeholders.

### Average Salary by Company Location

One of the key visualizations we created in PowerBI is the average `salary_in_usd` by `company_location`. This visualization helps us identify geographical trends in salary distribution, allowing us to see which locations offer higher average salaries for data engineers.

<br />
### Sum of Remote Ratio by Salary and Company Size

Another important visualization is the sum of `remote_ratio` by `salary_in_usd` and `company_size`. This chart provides insights into how remote work opportunities are distributed across different salary levels and company sizes, helping us understand the relationship between remote work and compensation.

<br />
### Average Salary by Company Size and Experience Level

We also visualize the average `salary_in_usd` by `company_size` and `experience_level`. This allows us to analyze how company size and experience level impact salary, providing valuable information for both job seekers and employers.

<br />
### Average Salary by Currency and Employment Type

Lastly, we created a visualization showing the average `salary_in_usd` by `salary_currency` and `employment_type`. This helps us understand how different currencies and employment types (e.g., full-time, part-time) affect salary levels, offering a comprehensive view of salary variations across different job conditions.

### Conclusion

By utilizing PowerBI, we can transform complex data into easy-to-understand visualizations that provide actionable insights. These visualizations play a crucial role in our project, enabling better decision-making and strategic planning based on data-driven insights.
