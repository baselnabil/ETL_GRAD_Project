# GradSync aims to integrate data from various sources to gain valuable insights.
## We employ a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process data from different formats and sources, clean and merge it, and store it in optimized database systems for further analysis.

<br />
### ETL Pipeline

Our ETL pipeline is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently, ensuring that the data is transformed and loaded into the database systems in a timely manner. We also implement various data validation and quality checks to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data.
<br />
### Machine Learning

In addition to the ETL process, we are also leveraging machine learning techniques to predict experience levels based on the integrated data. By analyzing patterns and trends in the data, we can develop predictive models that provide valuable insights into the experience levels of individuals. These models can be used to make informed decisions and improve various processes within the organization.
<br />
### Data Visualization

Furthermore, GradSync includes a comprehensive data visualization component using PowerBI. PowerBI allows us to create interactive dashboards and reports that enable users to explore the data and gain insights in a user-friendly manner. These visualizations help in identifying key trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data, enabling better decision-making and strategic planning. PowerBI's robust features and integration capabilities make it an ideal tool for visualizing complex data sets and sharing insights across the organization.
<br />
### Tools and Technologies

Our ETL pipeline is built using industry-standard tools and technologies to ensure robustness and scalability. We use Docker to containerize our applications, making it easy to deploy and manage them across different environments. This containerization approach also allows us to scale our ETL pipeline horizontally, handling increasing data volumes without compromising performance.
<br />
### Workflow Orchestration with Apache Airflow

To manage and orchestrate our ETL workflows, we use Apache Airflow. Airflow allows us to define, schedule, and monitor complex workflows programmatically. With its powerful scheduling capabilities and rich user interface, we can easily manage dependencies, retry failed tasks, and visualize the execution of our ETL processes. Airflow's extensibility also enables us to integrate with various data sources and destinations, making it a versatile tool for our data engineering needs.
<br />
### Best Practices

We also employ best practices in data engineering to ensure the maintainability and extensibility of our ETL pipeline. Our codebase is modular and well-documented, making it easy for new team members to understand and contribute to GradSync. We use version control systems to track changes and collaborate effectively with other team members.
