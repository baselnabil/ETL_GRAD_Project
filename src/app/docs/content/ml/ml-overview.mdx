title: Machine Learning Model Overview
description: Analyzing the approach and rationale behind using Random Forest for predicting data engineer experience levels based on job-related features.
---

In this project, we focus on predicting the **experience level** of data engineers based on various features such as `job_title`, `employment_type`, `remote_ratio`, `work_year`, and other relevant attributes. The objective is to predict the `experience_level` (e.g., Junior, Senior, etc.) for individuals based on their job characteristics and work conditions.
<br />

### Why Random Forest?

We chose Random Forest for this model due to its advantages:
- **Robustness to Overfitting**: Random Forest is a powerful ensemble technique that builds multiple decision trees using different subsets of data, reducing overfitting risks that occur with single decision tree models.
- **Handling Categorical Variables**: The dataset contains both numerical features like `work_year`, `salary_in_usd`, and categorical features like `job_title`, `employment_type`, and `company_location`. Random Forest can effectively handle this mix of feature types.
- **Feature Importance**: It helps in identifying the importance of each feature in predicting the target variable, which is useful for understanding the main drivers of experience level variation.

<br />

### Why not Logistic Regression?

While Logistic Regression is a common algorithm for classification tasks, it was not used in this case due to the complexity of the data and the presence of non-linear relationships between features and experience level. Additionally, linear models may not handle interactions between features (such as `job_title` and `employment_type`) as effectively as Random Forest.
<br />

### Target Variable: `experience_level`

The target variable is `experience_level`, which classifies individuals into different experience categories (e.g., Junior, Mid, Senior). Predicting experience levels can provide insights into how different features like `job_title`, `employment_type`, and `remote_ratio` contribute to an individual's career progression.

<br />

### Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Any missing values in key features such as `job_title`, `employment_type`, or `remote_ratio` were addressed through imputation or removal to ensure model performance is not affected by incomplete data.
- **Class Imbalance**: To handle class imbalance, particularly for the `experience_level` variable, we employed techniques such as `resample` to ensure the model receives balanced training data for each experience level.

<br />

### Why Predict Experience Level?

Predicting experience level is crucial for understanding how job-related factors like `job_title`, company size, and location influence career progression. This can provide valuable insights for companies in hiring and career planning, as well as for individuals in understanding how their job conditions may affect their growth opportunities.
