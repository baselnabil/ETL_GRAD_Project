title: Machine Learning Model Overview
description: Analyzing the approach and rationale behind using Random Forest for predicting data engineer salaries based on job-related features.
---

In this project, we focus on predicting the salaries of data engineers based on various features such as `experience_level`, `job_title`, `employment_type`, `remote_ratio`, and other relevant attributes. The objective is to predict the `salary` as well as the `salary_in_usd` for individuals based on their work conditions and job characteristics.
<br />
### Why Random Forest?

We chose Random Forest for this model due to its advantages:
- **Robustness to Overfitting**: Random Forest is a powerful ensemble technique that builds multiple decision trees using different subsets of data, reducing overfitting risks that occur with single decision tree models.
- **Handling Categorical Variables**: The dataset contains both numerical features like `work_year`, `salary`, and categorical features like `experience_level`, `job_title`, and `company_location`. Random Forest can effectively handle this mix of feature types.
- **Feature Importance**: It helps in identifying the importance of each feature in predicting the target variable, which is useful for understanding the main drivers of salary variation.
<br />

### Why not Linear Regression?

While Linear Regression is a common algorithm for predicting continuous variables, it was not used in this case due to the complexity of the data and the presence of non-linear relationships between features and salary. Additionally, linear models may not handle the interaction between features (such as `job_title` and `experience_level`) as well as Random Forest.
<br />

### Target Variable: `salary_in_usd`

The target variable is `salary_in_usd`, which allows us to standardize salary predictions across different currencies and provide a consistent comparison. This also helps in building a model that generalizes better across geographic regions.
<br />

### Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Any missing values in key features such as `job_title`, `salary`, or `remote_ratio` were addressed through imputation or removal to ensure model performance is not affected by incomplete data.
- **Class Imbalance**: To handle class imbalance, particularly for categorical variables like `employment_type` and `experience_level`, we employed techniques such as `resample` to ensure the model receives balanced training data.
<br />

### Why Predict Salary?

Predicting salary based on job-related factors is essential for understanding how different features like `experience_level`, company size, and location impact salary levels. This can provide valuable insights to both job seekers and employers in terms of salary expectations and negotiations.

By using Random Forest and focusing on `salary_in_usd`, we can make accurate predictions and derive insights into the factors that influence salary outcomes for data engineers across the industry.
